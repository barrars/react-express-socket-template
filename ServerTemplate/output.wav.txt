 This call is now
 being recorded.
 All right.
 I got the recorder
 on and it's
 February 22, 2023,
 401pm and my name
 is Scott and I'm
 a defense
 investigator and I
 work for the
 defense attorney
 that represents
 Lindsay Calhoun.
 And did you catch
 all that on the
 phone?
 Yes, I heard all
 that.
 Okay.
 And could you
 please identify
 yourself?
 This is Sergeant
 Josh Windborn with
 the Washington
 State Patrol and I
 do give you
 permission to
 record.
 Great.
 I appreciate it.
 Thank you.
 And thank you for
 being available for
 this phone call.
 I know the case, we
 kind of mentioned
 this in the email.
 This is a really
 old case.
 So it's just the
 best of your memory
.
 Maybe you don't
 remember something,
 you know, it's
 totally fine.
 Yeah.
 I can tell you
 right now I looked
 at the report when
 I got it and I did
 not recall anything
 of this aside from
 what I can see what
 I wrote up from the
 report.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 That's a question.
 I'll find it in the
 report.
 That makes sense.
 So maybe let's see.
 I had some notes
 from something else
.
 Do you have any
 impressions though
 on this back then
 they were using,
 was it the, it wasn
't
 the dragger, but it
 was the other?
 The data master BAC
.
 Data master.
 Yeah.
 Do you have any
 opinion on maybe
 the accuracy of the
 data master versus
 the dragger or the
 draggers better?
 The ones, you know,
 the machines that
 they are being
 currently used, are
 they better
 than the ones that
 you used to use?
 I mean, I really
 don't have opinion
 either way.
 They give me the
 tool.
 I just follow
 directions on how
 it works and that's
 kind of what I do.
 So, I have using
 both.
 I have yet to find
 that it was, I
 would say offered
 like, I have to
 have any issues
 with
 them.
 Okay.
 Let's see.
 I'm trying to kind
 of just shortcut a
 little bit.
 And back on this
 time, back in 2011,
 October 26, 2011,
 did you have a dash
 cam in your
 car?
 Do you remember?
 Bear witness, thank
 you.
 And this came from
 a collision, right?
 To be honest with
 you, I'm not sure
 if I had a dash cam
 at that time or not
.
 Over my time, I did
 have a one of the
 older dash cam,
 which is VHS, back
 in the day.
 And then obviously
 got rid of that and
 then eventually had
 a, what we have now
, which is
 the Coban system,
 which I had for
 quite a bit of time
.
 I just don't recall
 if back in 2011, if
 I had a dash cam or
 not, at that time.
 Okay.
 Let's check on my
 notes here.
 And then back with
 the data master
 versus the driver,
 I have seen in some
 reports where
 sometimes the
 machine will,
 somebody will be
 trying to give a
 sample and it'll, I
 don't
 know, error out.
 I'm not really sure
 exactly what it is,
 but that's, you
 know, where a
 trooper will have
 to move to another
 machine.
 With the driver
 error more than, or
 the data master,
 does that error
 more than the
 drivers
 have?
 I don't know, to be
 honest with you, I
 don't.
 Like in your
 experience, did the
 data master ever
 error out?
 There had been like
, there had been
 like very rare
 occasions where it
 had an error,
 depending
 on the situation, I
 guess.
 But obviously there
's different
 situations where
 there'd be
 different errors.
 But yeah, otherwise
 if it gives you a
 reading, then the
 assumption is no
 error.
 Right.
 Typically, if it
 goes through the
 process, that means
 it's done through
 check and balances
 and that the
 percentage is not
 off by more than
 that, whatever that
 certain percentage
 is between the two
 breast samples and
 the center, all the
 checks.
 So if it's got a
 fail state,
 obviously, so if
 there was a problem
 within the tracks,
 then it would error
 out and not allow
 you to continue on.
 Okay.
 And then with the
 dash cam, you said
 you weren't sure.
 Do you know if the,
 with the retention
 duration is on
 those?
 If there was video,
 would that still be
 available?
 Do a normal public
 records request?
 Yeah, I'm not sure.
 I know what the, I
'm not sure what the
 retention period is
 for it.
 Okay.
 I'm under the
 assumption that the
 retention period
 for the report
 itself had already
 come
 and gone.
 It might have been
 like a 10 year, but
 I'm not the public
 disclosure person.
 They know that.
 They know more than
 I do about that
 stuff.
 So it's, like, I'm
 not sure if the
 videos are the same
 as the paperwork,
 but, and I'm
 looking at, I'm
 doing a little bit
 of reasserting bear
 with me.
 As I fumble through
 here, I was trying
 to pull up a little
 research to see if
 maybe I
 had something that
 would tell me if I
 had a dash cam at
 the time.
 And so I went to my
 tar, which is our
 daily activity,
 time activity
 report that we do
 every day when we
 work.
 It keeps track of
 traffic stops,
 collisions,
 everything,
 everything that we
 come in contact
 with, with somebody
 or doing something,
 it keeps track of
 our time.
 And on that tar, we
 usually also keep
 track of, like
 camera check times
 and stuff.
 So if I had, if I
 had co-banned for a
 camera back at that
 time, I would have
 to do a check,
 pre-check of the
 camera before my
 shift starts to
 make sure that it's
 operating correctly
.
 And so I am looking
 at the tar, but it
 doesn't list, it
 doesn't show
 anything on the
 back.
 Whether there is,
 they didn't show a
 camera check time,
 but it also doesn't
 show a radar
 check time, it
 doesn't show my
 patrol vehicle
 license.
 All these things
 are things that I
 would normally put
 on my tar every day
.
 So my assumption is
 that at one point
 we want from paper
 tar to electronic
 tar, and so
 it might have
 probably been like
 a paper tar from
 back then and
 submitted into the
 system.
 And this is how we
 submitted it.
 Okay, and then it
 looks like the only
 FST that was done,
 let's see, there
 was an HTN done.
 And then I'm
 assuming, pretty
 much nothing
 outside of it.
 So like she had a
 cast on her foot,
 but she was able to
 stand there, like
 that was the
 one thing she could
 do, she could stand
, you know, with her
 shoulders, I don't
 know, level.
 Right, yeah, so she
 was able to stand
 to do the
 horizontal and
 stagnant test, but
 because
 of the cast and she
 said that she'd
 hurt her, obviously
 wearing a cast, but
 she'd hurt
 her friend or ankle
 from tripping over
 a dog.
 Do you remember if
 it was like a
 walking cast, or
 did she have crut
ches or something to
 assist?
 I do not recall.
 Okay.
 And then she stated
 no to whether or
 not she drank any
 alcohol, but she
 said she had
 taken prescription
 medication, Paxil.
 And how did you
 training in the
 experience?
 Is that a
 medication that can
 affect driving?
 I do not know.
 And at the time
 that she told me, I
 don't think I knew
 if Paxil was an
 impairing type
 medication or not.
 Do you recall if
 there was any
 occupants with her?
 Was she the only
 one in the car?
 Yeah, she was the
 only one.
 Okay.
 And then it looks
 like, just the
 overall, your
 report indicates
 that she was pretty
 cooperative.
 She understood when
 you went over and
 applied consent and
 her constitutional
 rights.
 Yeah.
 Did the other
 driver recall when
 you contacted them,
 did they have
 suspicion or did
 they
 suspect that this
 other driver that
 rear ended them was
 possibly under the
 influence?
 Um, let me see.
 Uh, not that I
 recall, there's
 nothing more to
 force it indicates
 that that was the
 case.
 Okay, and then the
 original dispatch
 call, you say, the
 WSP Communications
 Advise of
 a collision
 partially blocking
 the ramp.
 Do you know if the
 call came in from
 one of the people
 involved in the
 collision or was
 it just a passerby?
 I do not recall.
 Um, I think that
 might be just about
 it then.
 As far as, yeah, I
 mean there wasn't a
 whole...
 Let me see.
 Do you recall if
 she seemed kind of
 like down into
 practice, was she
 crying or emotional
?
 I'm looking at the
 checkbox of the
 peer-res
 observations and it
's not...
 Yeah, I just, I
 just looked at her
 and she, she was
 like, she's
 cooperative and all
 that
 stuff.
 And then I was just
 going to do my
 report real quick
 and skim it to see
 if I saw anything.
 Okay.
 Yeah, all right, I
 think that's it.
 Uh, I really
 appreciate it.
 Um, I doubt there
 will be any follow-
up, but yeah, I'll
 let the attorney
 know what we went
 over and hopefully
 that should be it.
 Sure.
 I appreciate it.
 Thank you very much
.
 Yes, no problem.
 Alright, have a
 good one.
 You too.
 Bye.
