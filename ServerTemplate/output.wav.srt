1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
 This call is now

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,000
 being recorded.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 All right.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,740
 I got the recorder

5
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,180
 on and it's

6
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,380
 February 22, 2023,

7
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,980
 401pm and my name

8
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,160
 is Scott and I'm

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,760
 a defense

10
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,530
 investigator and I

11
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,110
 work for the

12
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,030
 defense attorney

13
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,830
 that represents

14
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,520
 Lindsay Calhoun.

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,400
 And did you catch

16
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,150
 all that on the

17
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,680
 phone?

18
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,090
 Yes, I heard all

19
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,840
 that.

20
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
 Okay.

21
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,430
 And could you

22
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,200
 please identify

23
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,840
 yourself?

24
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,900
 This is Sergeant

25
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,100
 Josh Windborn with

26
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,280
 the Washington

00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,230
 State Patrol and I

28
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,060
 do give you

29
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,360
 permission to

30
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 record.

31
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
 Great.

32
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 I appreciate it.

33
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 Thank you.

34
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,510
 And thank you for

35
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,150
 being available for

36
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,200
 this phone call.

37
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,370
 I know the case, we

38
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,350
 kind of mentioned

39
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,560
 this in the email.

40
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,390
 This is a really

41
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,960
 old case.

42
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,250
 So it's just the

43
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,880
 best of your memory

44
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,160
.

45
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,930
 Maybe you don't

46
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,080
 remember something,

47
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,350
 you know, it's

48
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,640
 totally fine.

49
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
 Yeah.

50
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,850
 I can tell you

51
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,560
 right now I looked

52
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,150
 at the report when

53
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,580
 I got it and I did

54
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,680
 not recall anything

55
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,180
 of this aside from

56
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,670
 what I can see what

57
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,180
 I wrote up from the

58
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,120
 report.

59
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
 Okay.

60
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
 Okay.

61
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
 That's a question.

62
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,420
 I'll find it in the

63
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,200
 report.

64
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
 That makes sense.

65
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 So maybe let's see.

66
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,290
 I had some notes

67
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,970
 from something else

68
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,000
.

69
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
 Do you have any

70
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,250
 impressions though

71
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,370
 on this back then

72
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,490
 they were using,

73
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,680
 was it the, it wasn

74
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,760
't

75
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,100
 the dragger, but it

76
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,240
 was the other?

77
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,000
 The data master BAC

78
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,360
.

79
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
 Data master.

80
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
 Yeah.

81
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,400
 Do you have any

82
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,800
 opinion on maybe

83
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,180
 the accuracy of the

84
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,490
 data master versus

85
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,760
 the dragger or the

86
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,920
 draggers better?

87
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
 The ones, you know,

88
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,780
 the machines that

89
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,430
 they are being

90
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,440
 currently used, are

91
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,080
 they better

92
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,430
 than the ones that

93
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,840
 you used to use?

94
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,240
 I mean, I really

95
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,820
 don't have opinion

96
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,080
 either way.

97
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,730
 They give me the

98
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,080
 tool.

99
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,350
 I just follow

100
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,100
 directions on how

101
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,950
 it works and that's

102
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,880
 kind of what I do.

103
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,490
 So, I have using

104
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,320
 both.

105
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,970
 I have yet to find

106
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,310
 that it was, I

107
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,050
 would say offered

108
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,540
 like, I have to

109
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,160
 have any issues

110
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,360
 with

111
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 them.

112
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 Okay.

113
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,520
 Let's see.

114
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,600
 I'm trying to kind

115
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,690
 of just shortcut a

116
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,400
 little bit.

117
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,900
 And back on this

118
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,810
 time, back in 2011,

119
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,100
 October 26, 2011,

120
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,790
 did you have a dash

121
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,960
 cam in your

122
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
 car?

123
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
 Do you remember?

124
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:50,440
 Bear witness, thank

125
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,960
 you.

126
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
 And this came from

127
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,080
 a collision, right?

128
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,600
 To be honest with

129
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,420
 you, I'm not sure

130
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,870
 if I had a dash cam

131
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,990
 at that time or not

132
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,160
.

133
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,530
 Over my time, I did

134
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,440
 have a one of the

135
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,500
 older dash cam,

136
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,910
 which is VHS, back

137
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,640
 in the day.

138
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
 And then obviously

139
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
 got rid of that and

140
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
 then eventually had

141
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,410
 a, what we have now

142
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,840
, which is

143
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,160
 the Coban system,

144
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,150
 which I had for

145
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,430
 quite a bit of time

146
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,680
.

147
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,300
 I just don't recall

148
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,380
 if back in 2011, if

149
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,550
 I had a dash cam or

150
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,240
 not, at that time.

151
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
 Okay.

152
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,050
 Let's check on my

153
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,320
 notes here.

154
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,050
 And then back with

155
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,630
 the data master

156
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,530
 versus the driver,

157
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,230
 I have seen in some

158
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,720
 reports where

159
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,500
 sometimes the

160
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,350
 machine will,

161
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,550
 somebody will be

162
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,110
 trying to give a

163
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,200
 sample and it'll, I

164
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,640
 don't

165
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
 know, error out.

166
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,320
 I'm not really sure

167
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,030
 exactly what it is,

168
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,620
 but that's, you

169
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,120
 know, where a

170
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
 trooper will have

171
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,750
 to move to another

172
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,080
 machine.

173
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,130
 With the driver

174
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,490
 error more than, or

175
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,700
 the data master,

176
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,740
 does that error

177
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,720
 more than the

178
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,040
 drivers

179
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 have?

180
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,210
 I don't know, to be

181
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,740
 honest with you, I

182
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,000
 don't.

183
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,670
 Like in your

184
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,190
 experience, did the

185
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,300
 data master ever

186
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
 error out?

187
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,540
 There had been like

188
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,570
, there had been

189
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,840
 like very rare

190
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,970
 occasions where it

191
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,230
 had an error,

192
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,320
 depending

193
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,990
 on the situation, I

194
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,960
 guess.

195
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
 But obviously there

196
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,590
's different

197
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,470
 situations where

198
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:43,980
 there'd be

199
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,120
 different errors.

200
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,230
 But yeah, otherwise

201
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,740
 if it gives you a

202
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,190
 reading, then the

203
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,430
 assumption is no

204
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,320
 error.

205
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
 Right.

206
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,410
 Typically, if it

207
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,420
 goes through the

208
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,800
 process, that means

209
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,790
 it's done through

210
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,040
 check and balances

211
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,910
 and that the

212
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,220
 percentage is not

213
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,360
 off by more than

214
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,920
 that, whatever that

215
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
 certain percentage

216
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,280
 is between the two

217
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,140
 breast samples and

218
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,040
 the center, all the

219
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,600
 checks.

220
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,750
 So if it's got a

221
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,620
 fail state,

222
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,950
 obviously, so if

223
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,650
 there was a problem

224
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,920
 within the tracks,

225
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,630
 then it would error

226
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,120
 out and not allow

227
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,080
 you to continue on.

228
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 Okay.

229
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,340
 And then with the

230
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,780
 dash cam, you said

231
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,400
 you weren't sure.

232
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,190
 Do you know if the,

233
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,010
 with the retention

234
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,360
 duration is on

235
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
 those?

236
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,110
 If there was video,

237
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,820
 would that still be

238
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,400
 available?

239
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,690
 Do a normal public

240
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,200
 records request?

241
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,680
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

242
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,020
 I know what the, I

243
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,360
'm not sure what the

244
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,950
 retention period is

245
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,000
 for it.

246
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Okay.

247
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
 I'm under the

248
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,990
 assumption that the

249
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,870
 retention period

250
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,110
 for the report

251
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,440
 itself had already

252
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,600
 come

253
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 and gone.

254
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,380
 It might have been

255
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,460
 like a 10 year, but

256
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,220
 I'm not the public

257
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,320
 disclosure person.

258
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
 They know that.

259
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,630
 They know more than

260
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,470
 I do about that

261
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,120
 stuff.

262
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,050
 So it's, like, I'm

263
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,210
 not sure if the

264
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,000
 videos are the same

265
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,970
 as the paperwork,

266
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,320
 but, and I'm

267
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,450
 looking at, I'm

268
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,730
 doing a little bit

269
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,040
 of reasserting bear

270
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
 with me.

271
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,150
 As I fumble through

272
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,280
 here, I was trying

273
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,420
 to pull up a little

274
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,080
 research to see if

275
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,200
 maybe I

276
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,490
 had something that

277
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,650
 would tell me if I

278
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,660
 had a dash cam at

279
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,560
 the time.

280
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
 And so I went to my

281
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,640
 tar, which is our

282
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,980
 daily activity,

283
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,590
 time activity

284
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,720
 report that we do

285
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,300
 every day when we

286
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,120
 work.

287
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,960
 It keeps track of

288
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
 traffic stops,

289
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,530
 collisions,

290
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,340
 everything,

291
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,230
 everything that we

292
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,080
 come in contact

293
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,480
 with, with somebody

294
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
 or doing something,

295
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
 it keeps track of

296
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
 our time.

297
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
 And on that tar, we

298
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,990
 usually also keep

299
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,240
 track of, like

300
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
 camera check times

301
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
 and stuff.

302
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,950
 So if I had, if I

303
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,380
 had co-banned for a

304
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,240
 camera back at that

305
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,310
 time, I would have

306
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,920
 to do a check,

307
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,400
 pre-check of the

308
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
 camera before my

309
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,130
 shift starts to

310
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,760
 make sure that it's

311
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,720
 operating correctly

312
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:11,720
.

313
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
 And so I am looking

314
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,730
 at the tar, but it

315
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,600
 doesn't list, it

316
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,730
 doesn't show

317
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,060
 anything on the

318
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,200
 back.

319
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,660
 Whether there is,

320
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,490
 they didn't show a

321
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,760
 camera check time,

322
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,950
 but it also doesn't

323
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,760
 show a radar

324
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,370
 check time, it

325
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,000
 doesn't show my

326
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,610
 patrol vehicle

327
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,160
 license.

328
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,500
 All these things

329
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,530
 are things that I

330
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,890
 would normally put

331
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,170
 on my tar every day

332
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,520
.

333
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,350
 So my assumption is

334
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,950
 that at one point

335
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,670
 we want from paper

336
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,380
 tar to electronic

337
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,600
 tar, and so

338
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,500
 it might have

339
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,760
 probably been like

340
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,800
 a paper tar from

341
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,940
 back then and

342
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,040
 submitted into the

343
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,840
 system.

344
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,150
 And this is how we

345
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,320
 submitted it.

346
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,610
 Okay, and then it

347
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,050
 looks like the only

348
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,600
 FST that was done,

349
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,590
 let's see, there

350
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,240
 was an HTN done.

351
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,950
 And then I'm

352
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,100
 assuming, pretty

353
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,900
 much nothing

354
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,960
 outside of it.

355
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,830
 So like she had a

356
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,830
 cast on her foot,

357
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,830
 but she was able to

358
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,910
 stand there, like

359
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,640
 that was the

360
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,660
 one thing she could

361
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,750
 do, she could stand

362
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,910
, you know, with her

363
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,000
 shoulders, I don't

364
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,840
 know, level.

365
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,800
 Right, yeah, so she

366
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,560
 was able to stand

367
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,940
 to do the

368
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,800
 horizontal and

369
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,640
 stagnant test, but

370
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,720
 because

371
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,830
 of the cast and she

372
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,920
 said that she'd

373
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,070
 hurt her, obviously

374
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,300
 wearing a cast, but

375
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,080
 she'd hurt

376
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
 her friend or ankle

377
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,640
 from tripping over

378
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,240
 a dog.

379
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,390
 Do you remember if

380
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,150
 it was like a

381
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,410
 walking cast, or

382
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,500
 did she have crut

383
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,280
ches or something to

384
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,640
 assist?

385
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 I do not recall.

386
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
 Okay.

387
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,940
 And then she stated

388
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,860
 no to whether or

389
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,940
 not she drank any

390
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,090
 alcohol, but she

391
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,640
 said she had

392
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,650
 taken prescription

393
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,040
 medication, Paxil.

394
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,080
 And how did you

395
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
 training in the

396
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
 experience?

397
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
 Is that a

398
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,530
 medication that can

399
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,120
 affect driving?

400
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,880
 I do not know.

401
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,770
 And at the time

402
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,960
 that she told me, I

403
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
 don't think I knew

404
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,060
 if Paxil was an

405
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,080
 impairing type

406
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,360
 medication or not.

407
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,050
 Do you recall if

408
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,870
 there was any

409
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,960
 occupants with her?

410
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,300
 Was she the only

411
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,960
 one in the car?

412
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,310
 Yeah, she was the

413
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,240
 only one.

414
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
 Okay.

415
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,910
 And then it looks

416
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,100
 like, just the

417
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 overall, your

418
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,440
 report indicates

419
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,870
 that she was pretty

420
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,240
 cooperative.

421
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,790
 She understood when

422
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,990
 you went over and

423
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,440
 applied consent and

424
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,990
 her constitutional

425
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,360
 rights.

426
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,960
 Yeah.

427
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,170
 Did the other

428
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,930
 driver recall when

429
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,930
 you contacted them,

430
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,130
 did they have

431
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,700
 suspicion or did

432
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,200
 they

433
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,790
 suspect that this

434
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,000
 other driver that

435
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
 rear ended them was

436
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,990
 possibly under the

437
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,200
 influence?

438
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 Um, let me see.

439
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,380
 Uh, not that I

440
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,620
 recall, there's

441
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:19,880
 nothing more to

442
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,410
 force it indicates

443
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,270
 that that was the

444
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,560
 case.

445
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,430
 Okay, and then the

446
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,620
 original dispatch

447
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,310
 call, you say, the

448
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,330
 WSP Communications

449
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,320
 Advise of

450
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,710
 a collision

451
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,460
 partially blocking

452
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,640
 the ramp.

453
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
 Do you know if the

454
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
 call came in from

455
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,430
 one of the people

456
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,040
 involved in the

457
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,160
 collision or was

458
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,560
 it just a passerby?

459
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,200
 I do not recall.

460
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,050
 Um, I think that

461
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,300
 might be just about

462
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
 it then.

463
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
 As far as, yeah, I

464
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,720
 mean there wasn't a

465
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
 whole...

466
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
 Let me see.

467
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,930
 Do you recall if

468
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,110
 she seemed kind of

469
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,860
 like down into

470
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,790
 practice, was she

471
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,900
 crying or emotional

472
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,560
?

473
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,510
 I'm looking at the

474
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,200
 checkbox of the

475
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
 peer-res

476
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,450
 observations and it

477
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,360
's not...

478
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,120
 Yeah, I just, I

479
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,820
 just looked at her

480
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,520
 and she, she was

481
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,070
 like, she's

482
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,930
 cooperative and all

483
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,240
 that

484
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
 stuff.

485
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,250
 And then I was just

486
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,740
 going to do my

487
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,770
 report real quick

488
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,820
 and skim it to see

489
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,240
 if I saw anything.

490
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
 Okay.

491
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,380
 Yeah, all right, I

492
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,680
 think that's it.

493
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,700
 Uh, I really

494
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,960
 appreciate it.

495
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,750
 Um, I doubt there

496
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,590
 will be any follow-

497
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,590
up, but yeah, I'll

498
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,270
 let the attorney

499
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,040
 know what we went

500
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,450
 over and hopefully

501
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,000
 that should be it.

502
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Sure.

503
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I appreciate it.

504
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,850
 Thank you very much

505
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,000
.

506
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Yes, no problem.

507
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
 Alright, have a

508
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,000
 good one.

509
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You too.

510
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Bye.
