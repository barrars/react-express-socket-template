WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
 This call is now

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.000
 being recorded.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 All right.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 I got the recorder

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.180
 on and it's

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.380
 February 22, 2023,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.980
 401pm and my name

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.160
 is Scott and I'm

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.760
 a defense

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.530
 investigator and I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.110
 work for the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.030
 defense attorney

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.830
 that represents

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.520
 Lindsay Calhoun.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.400
 And did you catch

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.150
 all that on the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 phone?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.090
 Yes, I heard all

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.840
 that.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.840
 Okay.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.430
 And could you

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.200
 please identify

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.840
 yourself?

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.900
 This is Sergeant

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
 Josh Windborn with

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.280
 the Washington

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.230
 State Patrol and I

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.060
 do give you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.360
 permission to

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360
 record.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 Great.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 I appreciate it.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 Thank you.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.510
 And thank you for

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.150
 being available for

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.200
 this phone call.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.370
 I know the case, we

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 kind of mentioned

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.560
 this in the email.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.390
 This is a really

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.960
 old case.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.250
 So it's just the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.880
 best of your memory

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.160
.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.930
 Maybe you don't

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.080
 remember something,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.350
 you know, it's

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.640
 totally fine.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 Yeah.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 I can tell you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.560
 right now I looked

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.150
 at the report when

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.580
 I got it and I did

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.680
 not recall anything

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.180
 of this aside from

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.670
 what I can see what

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.180
 I wrote up from the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 report.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 Okay.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 Okay.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 That's a question.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.420
 I'll find it in the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.200
 report.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.560
 That makes sense.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 So maybe let's see.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.290
 I had some notes

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 from something else

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.000
.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.920
 Do you have any

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 impressions though

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.370
 on this back then

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.490
 they were using,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.680
 was it the, it wasn

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.760
't

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.100
 the dragger, but it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.240
 was the other?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.000
 The data master BAC

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.360
.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 Data master.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 Yeah.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.400
 Do you have any

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.800
 opinion on maybe

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.180
 the accuracy of the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.490
 data master versus

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.760
 the dragger or the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.920
 draggers better?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 The ones, you know,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.780
 the machines that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 they are being

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.440
 currently used, are

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.080
 they better

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.430
 than the ones that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.840
 you used to use?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.240
 I mean, I really

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.820
 don't have opinion

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.080
 either way.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.730
 They give me the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.080
 tool.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.350
 I just follow

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 directions on how

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 it works and that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 kind of what I do.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490
 So, I have using

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.320
 both.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.970
 I have yet to find

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.310
 that it was, I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 would say offered

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.540
 like, I have to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.160
 have any issues

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 with

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.360
 them.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 Okay.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.520
 Let's see.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.600
 I'm trying to kind

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.690
 of just shortcut a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.400
 little bit.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900
 And back on this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.810
 time, back in 2011,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.100
 October 26, 2011,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.790
 did you have a dash

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.960
 cam in your

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 car?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960
 Do you remember?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:50.440
 Bear witness, thank

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.960
 you.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720
 And this came from

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.080
 a collision, right?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.600
 To be honest with

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.420
 you, I'm not sure

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 if I had a dash cam

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.990
 at that time or not

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.160
.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.530
 Over my time, I did

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.440
 have a one of the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500
 older dash cam,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.910
 which is VHS, back

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.640
 in the day.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.840
 And then obviously

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.000
 got rid of that and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.200
 then eventually had

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.410
 a, what we have now

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.840
, which is

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.160
 the Coban system,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.150
 which I had for

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.430
 quite a bit of time

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.680
.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.300
 I just don't recall

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.380
 if back in 2011, if

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.550
 I had a dash cam or

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.240
 not, at that time.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 Okay.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.050
 Let's check on my

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.320
 notes here.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.050
 And then back with

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.630
 the data master

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.530
 versus the driver,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.230
 I have seen in some

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.720
 reports where

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.500
 sometimes the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.350
 machine will,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.550
 somebody will be

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.110
 trying to give a

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.200
 sample and it'll, I

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.640
 don't

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 know, error out.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.320
 I'm not really sure

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.030
 exactly what it is,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.620
 but that's, you

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.120
 know, where a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.800
 trooper will have

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.750
 to move to another

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.080
 machine.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.130
 With the driver

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.490
 error more than, or

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.700
 the data master,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.740
 does that error

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.720
 more than the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.040
 drivers

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
 have?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.210
 I don't know, to be

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.740
 honest with you, I

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.000
 don't.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.670
 Like in your

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.190
 experience, did the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.300
 data master ever

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.000
 error out?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.540
 There had been like

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.570
, there had been

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.840
 like very rare

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.970
 occasions where it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.230
 had an error,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.320
 depending

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.990
 on the situation, I

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.960
 guess.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 But obviously there

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.590
's different

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.470
 situations where

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.980
 there'd be

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.120
 different errors.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.230
 But yeah, otherwise

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.740
 if it gives you a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.190
 reading, then the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.430
 assumption is no

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.320
 error.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320
 Right.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.410
 Typically, if it

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.420
 goes through the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.800
 process, that means

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.790
 it's done through

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.040
 check and balances

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.910
 and that the

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.220
 percentage is not

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.360
 off by more than

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.920
 that, whatever that

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.480
 certain percentage

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.280
 is between the two

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.140
 breast samples and

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.040
 the center, all the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.600
 checks.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.750
 So if it's got a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.620
 fail state,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.950
 obviously, so if

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.650
 there was a problem

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.920
 within the tracks,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.630
 then it would error

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.120
 out and not allow

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.080
 you to continue on.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 Okay.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.340
 And then with the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.780
 dash cam, you said

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.400
 you weren't sure.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.190
 Do you know if the,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.010
 with the retention

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.360
 duration is on

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.360
 those?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.110
 If there was video,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.820
 would that still be

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.400
 available?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.690
 Do a normal public

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.200
 records request?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.680
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.020
 I know what the, I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.360
'm not sure what the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.950
 retention period is

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.000
 for it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Okay.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.270
 I'm under the

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.990
 assumption that the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.870
 retention period

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.110
 for the report

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.440
 itself had already

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.600
 come

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600
 and gone.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.380
 It might have been

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.460
 like a 10 year, but

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.220
 I'm not the public

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.320
 disclosure person.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320
 They know that.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.630
 They know more than

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.470
 I do about that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.120
 stuff.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.050
 So it's, like, I'm

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.210
 not sure if the

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.000
 videos are the same

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.970
 as the paperwork,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.320
 but, and I'm

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.450
 looking at, I'm

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.730
 doing a little bit

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.040
 of reasserting bear

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.840
 with me.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.150
 As I fumble through

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.280
 here, I was trying

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.420
 to pull up a little

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.080
 research to see if

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.200
 maybe I

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.490
 had something that

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.650
 would tell me if I

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.660
 had a dash cam at

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.560
 the time.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 And so I went to my

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.640
 tar, which is our

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.980
 daily activity,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.590
 time activity

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.720
 report that we do

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.300
 every day when we

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.120
 work.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.960
 It keeps track of

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.800
 traffic stops,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.530
 collisions,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.340
 everything,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.230
 everything that we

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.080
 come in contact

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.480
 with, with somebody

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.920
 or doing something,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.880
 it keeps track of

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.840
 our time.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440
 And on that tar, we

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.990
 usually also keep

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.240
 track of, like

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.840
 camera check times

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.040
 and stuff.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.950
 So if I had, if I

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.380
 had co-banned for a

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.240
 camera back at that

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.310
 time, I would have

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.920
 to do a check,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.400
 pre-check of the

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.900
 camera before my

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.130
 shift starts to

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.760
 make sure that it's

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.720
 operating correctly

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.720
.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.000
 And so I am looking

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.730
 at the tar, but it

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.600
 doesn't list, it

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.730
 doesn't show

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.060
 anything on the

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.200
 back.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.660
 Whether there is,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.490
 they didn't show a

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.760
 camera check time,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.950
 but it also doesn't

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.760
 show a radar

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.370
 check time, it

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.000
 doesn't show my

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.610
 patrol vehicle

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.160
 license.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.500
 All these things

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.530
 are things that I

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.890
 would normally put

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.170
 on my tar every day

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.520
.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.350
 So my assumption is

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.950
 that at one point

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.670
 we want from paper

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.380
 tar to electronic

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.600
 tar, and so

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.500
 it might have

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.760
 probably been like

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.800
 a paper tar from

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.940
 back then and

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.040
 submitted into the

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.840
 system.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.150
 And this is how we

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.320
 submitted it.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.610
 Okay, and then it

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.050
 looks like the only

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.600
 FST that was done,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.590
 let's see, there

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.240
 was an HTN done.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.950
 And then I'm

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.100
 assuming, pretty

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.900
 much nothing

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.960
 outside of it.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.830
 So like she had a

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.830
 cast on her foot,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.830
 but she was able to

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.910
 stand there, like

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.640
 that was the

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.660
 one thing she could

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.750
 do, she could stand

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.910
, you know, with her

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.000
 shoulders, I don't

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.840
 know, level.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.800
 Right, yeah, so she

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.560
 was able to stand

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:20.940
 to do the

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.800
 horizontal and

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.640
 stagnant test, but

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:22.720
 because

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.830
 of the cast and she

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.920
 said that she'd

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.070
 hurt her, obviously

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.300
 wearing a cast, but

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.080
 she'd hurt

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.360
 her friend or ankle

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.640
 from tripping over

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.240
 a dog.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.390
 Do you remember if

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.150
 it was like a

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.410
 walking cast, or

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.500
 did she have crut

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.280
ches or something to

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.640
 assist?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 I do not recall.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640
 Okay.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.940
 And then she stated

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.860
 no to whether or

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.940
 not she drank any

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.090
 alcohol, but she

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.640
 said she had

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.650
 taken prescription

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.040
 medication, Paxil.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.080
 And how did you

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.120
 training in the

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.240
 experience?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.200
 Is that a

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.530
 medication that can

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.120
 affect driving?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.880
 I do not know.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.770
 And at the time

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.960
 that she told me, I

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.080
 don't think I knew

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.060
 if Paxil was an

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.080
 impairing type

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.360
 medication or not.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.050
 Do you recall if

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.870
 there was any

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.960
 occupants with her?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.300
 Was she the only

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.960
 one in the car?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.310
 Yeah, she was the

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.240
 only one.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.480
 Okay.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.910
 And then it looks

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.100
 like, just the

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.100
 overall, your

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.440
 report indicates

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.870
 that she was pretty

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.240
 cooperative.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.790
 She understood when

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.990
 you went over and

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.440
 applied consent and

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.990
 her constitutional

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.360
 rights.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.960
 Yeah.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.170
 Did the other

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.930
 driver recall when

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.930
 you contacted them,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.130
 did they have

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.700
 suspicion or did

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.200
 they

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.790
 suspect that this

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.000
 other driver that

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.480
 rear ended them was

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.990
 possibly under the

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.200
 influence?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 Um, let me see.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.380
 Uh, not that I

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.620
 recall, there's

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:19.880
 nothing more to

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.410
 force it indicates

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.270
 that that was the

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:30.560
 case.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.430
 Okay, and then the

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.620
 original dispatch

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.310
 call, you say, the

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.330
 WSP Communications

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.320
 Advise of

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.710
 a collision

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.460
 partially blocking

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.640
 the ramp.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.760
 Do you know if the

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.880
 call came in from

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.430
 one of the people

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.040
 involved in the

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.160
 collision or was

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.560
 it just a passerby?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.200
 I do not recall.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.050
 Um, I think that

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.300
 might be just about

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.200
 it then.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.960
 As far as, yeah, I

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.720
 mean there wasn't a

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.320
 whole...

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.560
 Let me see.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.930
 Do you recall if

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.110
 she seemed kind of

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.860
 like down into

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.790
 practice, was she

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.900
 crying or emotional

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.560
?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.510
 I'm looking at the

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.200
 checkbox of the

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.880
 peer-res

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.450
 observations and it

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.360
's not...

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.120
 Yeah, I just, I

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.820
 just looked at her

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.520
 and she, she was

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.070
 like, she's

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.930
 cooperative and all

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.240
 that

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240
 stuff.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.250
 And then I was just

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.740
 going to do my

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.770
 report real quick

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.820
 and skim it to see

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.240
 if I saw anything.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
 Okay.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.380
 Yeah, all right, I

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.680
 think that's it.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.700
 Uh, I really

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.960
 appreciate it.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.750
 Um, I doubt there

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.590
 will be any follow-

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.590
up, but yeah, I'll

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.270
 let the attorney

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.040
 know what we went

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.450
 over and hopefully

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.000
 that should be it.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Sure.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I appreciate it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.850
 Thank you very much

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.000
.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Yes, no problem.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.320
 Alright, have a

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.000
 good one.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 You too.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Bye.
